Description: A novel spatial topic model to integrate both cell type and spatial 
             information to identify the complex spatial tissue architecture on 
             multiplexed tissue images without human intervention. The Package 
             implements a Collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference. 
             SpaTopic is scalable to large-scale image datasets without extracting 
             neighborhood information for every single cell.
