Description: A novel spatial topic model to integrate both cell type and spatial 
             information to identify the complex spatial tissue architectures on 
             multiplexed tissue images without human intervention. The Package 
             implements a Collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference. 
             Contrasting to computationally intensive K-nearest-neighbor-based 
             cell neighborhood analysis approaches, SpaTopic is more scalable 
             to large-scale image datasets without extracting neighborhood 
             information for every single cell.
