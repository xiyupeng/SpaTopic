Description: Also called SpatialTopic. A novel spatial topic model to integrate both cell type and spatial information to identify the complex spatial tissue architecture on multiplexed tissue images without human intervention. The Package implements a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference. 'SpaTopic' (SpatialTopic) is highly scalable to large-scale image datasets without extracting neighborhood information for every single cell. For more details on the methodology, see <https://xiyupeng.github.io/SpaTopic/>.
